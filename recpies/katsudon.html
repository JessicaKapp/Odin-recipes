    <h3>A Delicious Dish</h3>
    <p> This succulent pork and rice dish will have you constantly coming back for more! One would think that, as a traditional japanese dish, this would be difficult to recreate in the american kitchen. Thankfully that isn't the case!</p>
 
    <p>Katsudon can be easily replicated with things you can find at any american grocery store. Some traditional items, like dashi, have been subbed out for more convenient items but over all the taste is still very good. Please give it a try! </p>

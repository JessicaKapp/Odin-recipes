    <h3>Crunchy Salty Chicken Thighs</h3>
    <p>I've been making this recipe since I was in college. Its so easy, delicious, and affordable!</p>
 
    <p>My favorite way of cooking this is in the air fryer, but cooking it old fashion style in the oven works just as well. It just takes longer.</p>
     
    
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> Four bone-in, skin on chicken thighs</li>
        <li> 3/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce</li>
     </ul>

     <h4>Preparation</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Clean and prep your chicken thighs. Add them to a small bowl or a resealable freezer bag, then pour in the soy sauce. Allow to marinated in the fridge for at least four hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390 then add the Chicken thighs. cook for 26-28 minutes depending on how crispy you like the skins.</li>
        <li>If you would rather use a traditional oven, preheat to 425. Add the chicken thighs to a lightly greased dish and cook for one hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve with white rice and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
